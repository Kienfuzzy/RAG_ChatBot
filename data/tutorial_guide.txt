Getting Started with FastAPI and Python Web Development

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. This tutorial will guide you through creating your first FastAPI application.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

Step 1: Installation
First, create a virtual environment and install FastAPI along with an ASGI server:

```bash
python -m venv fastapi-env
source fastapi-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fastapi-env\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Step 2: Create Your First API
Create a file named `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "query": q}
```

Step 3: Run the Application
Start the development server using uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Your API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

Next Steps:
- Learn about request bodies and validation with Pydantic
- Implement database integration
- Add authentication and security
- Deploy to production with Docker

FastAPI's automatic validation, serialization, and documentation make it an excellent choice for modern API development.
